    <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>Molly have been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <i>Nature, New Scientinst,</i> and all other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbbed copy of <i>On the Road.</i> It had been Molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>
    <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Quote Wilde Quote proclaiming that "Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do". Although many considered her pioneering work, unravelling the secrets of Ilama <abbr title="Daddy's Najayas Aulat">DNA</abbr> to be an outstanding achievement, Molly <i>did</i> think she had something better to do.</p>
